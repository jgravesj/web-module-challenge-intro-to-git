## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Version control system.
Git is is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. When developers are creating something they need to make constant changes to the code, releasing new versoins than the initial release. Version control sytems keep these new verions straight, stoiring the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to collaborate, make changes, and upload newest revisions.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Github serves as a host for Git repository teams to store their code and Git is a tool that is used to manage multiple veraions of source code eit.
3. Why do we create a branch?
Creating a branch allows development teams  to work on different parts of a project wothout interferring with each other.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
You can use the 'git switch' command to returnb to you previous branch.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
'git fetch'- command used to downaload the contents from a remote repository.
'git merge'- command lets you take the independent lines of development created by the git branch and intergrate them into a single branch.
''git pull'- command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote one.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolves fifferences in code betweem two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
To resolve a megre conflict the local state will need to be stabilized using git stash, git checkout, or git reset.
